	/**
	 * Create one predator, and multiple instances of prey.
	 * fitness goal is predator eating maximum amount of preys.
	 * predator: co-evolves with GP
	 * prey: is also evolved and runs from predator.
	 * fitness: averaged ! unknown so far. 
	 * 
	 *  GP Lang for only Predator-Prey Application: 
	 * 	Functions: IfPreyAhead, Behind, Right, Left, PROGN2 A B, PRGON3 A B C
	 *  Terminals: Move, Left, Right 
	 *  
	 *  GP Lang for only Predator-Prey co-evolve Application:
     *  	predator moves and eats preys and preys finds a way to get away from preds. 
	 *	
	 *	 	two functions: PredMoves  -> Running towards preys 											  -> returns >= 1 children
	 *	 				   PreyMoves  -> Running from Pred
	 *	 	Terminal sets: move(may include 8 direction movements), Left(Orientation), Right(Orientation) -> returns 0 children
	 *  
	 *  Simulation: update and record all entities - location, current predator's direction, 
	 *  time count, ...
	 *    
	 *  Predator Prey Application
	 *  	one predator eats multiple preys.
	 *  	simulation: 
	 *  		update and record the state of all entities. location, current predator direction,
	 *  		time count and others.
	 *  		Predators state changes according to the functions and terminals.
	 *  		Output: Predator movements, locations where prey eaten, location of live prey
	 *  
	 *  GPProblem now implements SimpleProblemForm. You'll need your own
		custom GPProblem to do GroupedProblemForm.
	 *  
	 *  
	 *  Individual -> is a candidate solution to a problem.
	 *  
	 *  M individuals are grouped together into a sample of solutions known as subpopulation.
	 *  
	 *  N subpopulations are grouped together into the system's population 
	 *  
	 *  species -> each subpopulation contains a species which defines the individuals used to fill the subpopulation, as well as their fitness and the means by which they are modified.

Although this method is not static, you should not use it to write to any instance variables in the GroupedProblem instance; this is because it's possible that the instance used is in fact the prototype, and you will have no guarantees that your instance variables will remain valid during the evaluate(...) process. Do not assume that pop will be the same as state.pop -- it may not. state is only provided to give you access to EvolutionState features.
//		countVictoriesOnly will be set if Individuals' fitness is to be based on whether they're the winner of a test, instead of based on the specifics of the scores in the tests. This really only happens for Single-Elimination Tournament one-population competitive coevolution. If this is set, probably would leave the Fitnesses as they are here (they've been set and incremented in evaluate(...)), but if it's not set, you may want to set the Fitnesses to the maximum or average or the various trials performed.
//
//		assessFitness will indicate which subpopulations should have their final fitness values assessed. You should not clear the trials of individuals for which assessFitness[] is false. Instead allow trials to accumulate and ultimately update the fitnesses later when the flag is set. assessFitness[] may not be the same as updateFitness[] in evaluate(...).
//
//		Should return the number of individuals evaluated (not tested: but actually had their fitnesses modified -- or would have if the evaluated flag wasn't set).
